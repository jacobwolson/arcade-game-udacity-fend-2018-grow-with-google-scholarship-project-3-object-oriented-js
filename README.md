# Clasic Arcade Game Project | Udacity FEND Nanodegree | 2018
Project 3 for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program; completed as part of the Grow with Google Scholarship Program, 2018.

A classic arcade game based on Frogger that required students to use object-oriented JavaScript to implement functionality to the provided art assets and game engine.

## Authors

Utilizing various sources, Jacob W. Olson added to and edited source code provided by Udacity, and utilized art assets provided by Udacity, to complete this project. Primary contributions to the project by Jacob W. Olson — drawing on sources noted including portions of Matthew Cranford's walkthrough for the project — are in the `app.js` file. Conributions by Jacob W. Olson also include the popover markup, styling and functionality — using and building on code inspired by W3 School's tutorial on the topic — as well some interaction between methods and variables found in `app.js`, and the `engine.js` and `resources.js` scripts provided by Udacity.

The foundational HTML and CSS code, in addition to the foundational `engine.js` and `resources.js` code, and the art assets were provided by Udacity as part of the source code for this project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to create a copy on your local machine. Click [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/ "GitHub Help — Clone a Repository") for help with this task from GitHub.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser. Some tips for doing this from Help Desk Geek are available [here](https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/open-an-html-file-in-google-chrome/ ).

    * As an alternative to steps one and two, you can run the repository's `index.html` file on [HTML Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jacobwolson/memory_game_project--udacity_fend_nanodegree--grow_with_google_scholarship_program--2018/blob/master/index.html).

3. Start playing!

## Playing the Game

* Your mission: get your avatar "home" to the destination on the other side of the canvas without colliding with any "enemies" — in this case: bugs.
* To control player: use arrow keys — up, down, right and left.
* If you collide with an enemy, your player will move back to the start position.
* After your player makes it "home" safely, you will have the option of selecting to play again.

## Acknowledgements

* Udacity.com supplied the initial HTML file, art assets, game engine and image loading utility for this project.

   * The author implemented the game's functionality by editing the app.js file and, where necessary, the engine.js file, utilizing object-oriented JavaScript wiht ES6 class syntax. The author also added headings and a popover to the HTML file, and styled both with CSS, and implemented popover functionality.

* Portions of Udacity student Matthew Cranford's series of "Arcade Game Walkthrough" posts on the project were consulted: https://matthewcranford.com/.

* The popover markup, stylings and implementation were adapted from code found in w3schools' post "How TO - CSS/JS Modal": https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp.

* This README was based on a template provided by Billie Thompson posting under the name "PurpleBooth" at https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2. A post by Matias Singers posting under the username "matiassingers" at https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme was also consulted.

* Udacity's FEND Nanodegree program provided the structure and much of the information I needed to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript -- including object-oriented JS -- which allowed me to successfully complete this project. My fellow Udacity students as well as the wider programming community also provided indispensable information, resources, support and encouragement.

* Funding for my learning through Udacity including this project comes courtesy of the Grow with Google Scholarship program.
